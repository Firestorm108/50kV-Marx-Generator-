# 50kV-Marx-Generator-
A 10 stage Marx generator powered by a 5kV NST! Creates pulse discharges of extreme power, much higher than a standard voltage multiplier. 
This should be a good tool for demonstrations and testing. It's quite loud though, imagine 10 tasers singing together and that's the Marx generator.
